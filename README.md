# HL-DuckSpam
DuckSpam bugged hl.dll for Half-Life, to do DuckSpam better, actually it works best with 1999FPS (host_framerate 0.0005), but you can do also with 999FPS (host_framerate 0.001), it will be different of 2k ups

# How to install
Just put hl.dll (from "bin" folder) into your Half-Life directory\valve\dlls with replace, better make a backup of original hl.dll before copying
